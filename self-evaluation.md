# Arrays Challenge Self-Evaluation

- **How confident do you feel with the content on Arrays so far?** I feel fairly confident with arrays so far, but feel that there is SO much more to learn about array methods.
- **Is there any additional learning you need or want to do before moving to the next lesson?** I feel like I have a good foundation of arrays, but I am looking forward to learning more practical use cases and more about other methods.
- **What questions do you have about Arrays?** I know in general there should not be the case to mix data types... However, can you think of any edge case scenario where there may need to be an array with mixed data types?
